# OrgScript

**Describe how your business works in a way that humans and machines can both interpret reliably.**

OrgScript is a human-readable, AI-friendly description language for business logic, operational processes, rules, roles, and state transitions. It sits between plain-language documentation and technical execution as a shared, text-first source of truth.

OrgScript is designed for operators, team leads, analysts, and engineers who need a shared, text-first source of truth for business logic.

## What OrgScript is

- A shared text layer for business logic.
- Readable by people.
- Parseable by software.
- Stable in Git and code review.
- Structured for AI analysis, validation, and export.

## What OrgScript is not

- Not a general-purpose programming language.
- Not a workflow engine.
- Not free-form prose or narrative documentation.
- Not a replacement for implementation code.

## Installation

OrgScript requires Node.js `>=18`.

The published npm package is scoped as `@dkfuh/orgscript`.

### Global install from npm

```bash
npm install -g @dkfuh/orgscript
```

That installs the CLI command as `orgscript`.

### Local repository setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DKFuH/OrgScript.git
cd OrgScript
npm install
```

This is the best path if you want to explore examples, run tests, or contribute.

### Global CLI from a local checkout

```bash
npm install -g .
```

That makes `orgscript` available on your shell path from the checked-out repository state.

## Quickstart in 60 seconds

After installation, run:

```bash
# 1. Check a complete example end to end
orgscript check ./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs

# 2. Generate a diagram
orgscript export mermaid ./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs

# 3. Generate a stakeholder-friendly summary
orgscript export markdown ./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs
```

If you want the fastest first read, start with:

- [craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs](./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs)
- [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md)

## Read this in order

If you are new to OrgScript, this is the intended reading path:

1. [docs/manifesto.md](./docs/manifesto.md) - Why OrgScript exists.
2. [docs/language-principles.md](./docs/language-principles.md) - The design constraints and non-negotiable rules.
3. [spec/language-spec.md](./spec/language-spec.md) - The canonical language definition.
4. [docs/orgscript-for-humans.md](./docs/orgscript-for-humans.md) - How to write maintainable OrgScript files.
5. [docs/orgscript-for-ai.md](./docs/orgscript-for-ai.md) - How tools and AI must interpret OrgScript without guessing.

## Canonical source of truth

The normative language reference is:

- [spec/language-spec.md](./spec/language-spec.md)

Supporting docs exist to help people adopt, use, and govern the language. If implementation and docs ever disagree, the canonical spec wins.

## From source to artifact

OrgScript is intentionally artifact-first. A single `.orgs` file can produce multiple useful outputs:

1. Source logic in plain text.
2. Validation and linting diagnostics.
3. Mermaid diagrams.
4. Markdown summaries.
5. HTML documentation.
6. BPMN skeleton exports.
7. LittleHorse workflow skeletons.
8. Graph JSON exports.
9. PlantUML skeleton exports.
10. OpenAPI-style contract metadata.
11. AI-ready structured JSON exports.

Generated examples live under:

- [docs/demos](./docs/demos)

## Exporter maturity matrix

To avoid false expectations, exporters are grouped by maturity level.

| Exporter | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `json` | stable | canonical model |
| `context` | stable | AI/tooling bundle |
| `markdown` | stable | human summary |
| `html` | stable | documentation page |
| `graph` | stable | nodes + edges |
| `contract` | experimental | scaffold |
| `bpmn` | experimental | skeleton |
| `plantuml` | experimental | skeleton |
| `littlehorse` | experimental | scaffold |

Experimental exporters are intended as skeletons or integration scaffolds and may require manual review.

## Hero demo: Craft Business Lead to Order

The main showcase flow is:

- Source: [craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs](./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs)
- Mermaid demo: [docs/demos/mermaid/craft-business-lead-to-order.mermaid.md](./docs/demos/mermaid/craft-business-lead-to-order.mermaid.md)
- Markdown demo: [docs/demos/markdown/craft-business-lead-to-order.summary.md](./docs/demos/markdown/craft-business-lead-to-order.summary.md)

## Core blocks

- `process`: step-by-step operational workflows
- `stateflow`: legal states and transitions
- `rule`: cross-cutting constraints and requirements
- `role`: permission boundaries
- `policy`: context-driven or time-driven behavior
- `event`: named triggers with reactions
- `metric`: tracked business measures

## Document language header, comments, and annotations

OrgScript can declare the intended language of human-authored text at document level:

```orgs
orgscript 1

source-language "en"
comment-language "de"
annotation-language "de"
context-language "de"
```

This header is metadata only:

- `source-language` documents the canonical source syntax language and remains `en` in v1
- `comment-language`, `annotation-language`, and `context-language` help humans, exporters, and AI understand the intended language of nearby text
- declared languages are treated as a document contract and may trigger lint warnings when comments or annotation values clearly drift

## Comments and annotations

OrgScript supports two documentation layers:

- `# comment` for human-only notes
- `@key "value"` for allowlisted structured metadata

Comments are non-authoritative and excluded from canonical export, AI context, analysis, and machine-facing evaluation by default.

Annotations are parseable metadata. In v1 the allowlist is:

- `@note`
- `@owner`
- `@todo`
- `@source`
- `@status`
- `@review`

Example:

```orgs
orgscript 1

source-language "en"
comment-language "en"
annotation-language "en"

# Shared lead qualification path for inbound leads.
@owner "sales_ops"
@status "active"
process LeadQualification

  # New leads enter the qualification flow when created.
  when lead.created
```

Export behavior:

- `orgscript export markdown <file>` and `orgscript export html <file>` omit annotation callouts and document language metadata by default.
- Add `--with-annotations` to Markdown or HTML export when you want allowlisted `@annotations` and declared document language metadata rendered in the generated documentation artifact.
- `orgscript export context <file>` includes explicit annotation metadata and declared document language metadata in the structured context payload so downstream AI/indexing consumers do not need to recover it from prose.

## CLI quick reference

Need command help? Run `orgscript --help` or `orgscript help <command>`.

```bash
orgscript validate <file> [--json]
orgscript lint <file> [--json]
orgscript check <file> [--json]
orgscript format <file> [--check]
orgscript export json <file>
orgscript export markdown <file>
orgscript export mermaid <file>
orgscript export html <file>
orgscript export bpmn <file>
orgscript export littlehorse <file>
orgscript export littlehorse <file> --littlehorse-real
orgscript export graph <file>
orgscript export plantuml <file>
orgscript export contract <file>
orgscript export context <file>
orgscript analyze <file> [--json]
```

Examples:

```bash
orgscript export markdown ./examples/lead-qualification.orgs --with-annotations
orgscript export html ./examples/lead-qualification.orgs --with-annotations
orgscript export context ./examples/lead-qualification.orgs
```

## Developer path

If you want to contribute to the tooling or language, this is a practical sequence:

1. Read [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md)
2. Run `orgscript check` on a real example
3. Inspect generated Mermaid or Markdown output
4. Read the canonical spec
5. Use [docs/governance.md](./docs/governance.md) before proposing core language changes

## Testing

```bash
npm test
npm run check:all
npm run demo:generate
```

Note: files under `tests/lint/` are intentionally invalid and are used to verify lint findings. Running `orgscript lint` on those fixtures is expected to fail.

## Security posture

An automated enterprise security scan found no sensitive data in source control, no hardcoded credentials, and no obvious insecure patterns in production code. External URLs and localhost references appear only in docs or demo/export artifacts. For production use, still review build/deploy pipelines, monitor dependencies, and perform periodic security testing. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for details and reporting guidance.
