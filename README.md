# OrgScript

**Describe how your business works in a way that humans and machines can both interpret reliably.**

OrgScript is a human-readable, AI-friendly description language for business logic, operational processes, rules, roles, and state transitions. It sits between plain-language documentation and technical execution as a shared, text-first source of truth.

OrgScript is designed for operators, team leads, analysts, and engineers who need a shared, text-first source of truth for business logic.

## What It Is

- A shared text layer for business logic
- Readable by people
- Parseable by software
- Stable in Git and code review
- Structured for AI analysis, validation, and export

## What It Is Not

- Not a general-purpose programming language
- Not a workflow engine
- Not free-form prose or narrative documentation
- Not a replacement for implementation code

## Installation

OrgScript requires Node.js `>=18`.

The published npm package is scoped as `@dkfuh/orgscript`.

### Global install from npm

```bash
npm install -g @dkfuh/orgscript
```

That installs the CLI command as `orgscript`.

### Local repository setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DKFuH/OrgScript.git
cd OrgScript
npm install
```

This is the best path if you want to explore examples, run tests, or contribute.

### Global CLI from a local checkout

```bash
npm install -g .
```

That makes `orgscript` available on your shell path from the checked-out repository state.

## Quickstart in 60 Seconds

After installation, run:

```bash
# 1. Check a complete example end to end
orgscript check ./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs

# 2. Generate a diagram
orgscript export mermaid ./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs

# 3. Generate a stakeholder-friendly summary
orgscript export markdown ./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs
```

If you want the fastest first read, start with:

- [craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs](./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs)
- [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md)

## Read This in Order

If you are new to OrgScript, this is the intended reading path:

1. [docs/manifesto.md](./docs/manifesto.md) - Why OrgScript exists.
2. [docs/language-principles.md](./docs/language-principles.md) - The design constraints and non-negotiable rules.
3. [spec/language-spec.md](./spec/language-spec.md) - The canonical language definition.
4. [docs/orgscript-for-humans.md](./docs/orgscript-for-humans.md) - How to write maintainable OrgScript files.
5. [docs/orgscript-for-ai.md](./docs/orgscript-for-ai.md) - How tools and AI must interpret OrgScript without guessing.

## Canonical Source of Truth

The normative language reference is:

- [spec/language-spec.md](./spec/language-spec.md)

Supporting docs exist to help people adopt, use, and govern the language. If implementation and docs ever disagree, the canonical spec wins.

## From Source to Artifact

OrgScript is intentionally artifact-first. A single `.orgs` file can produce multiple useful outputs:

1. Source logic in plain text
2. Validation and linting diagnostics
3. Mermaid diagrams
4. Markdown summaries
5. HTML documentation
6. AI-ready structured JSON exports

Generated examples live under:

- [docs/demos](./docs/demos)

## Hero Demo: Craft Business Lead to Order

The main showcase flow is:

- Source: [craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs](./examples/craft-business-lead-to-order.orgs)
- Mermaid demo: [docs/demos/mermaid/craft-business-lead-to-order.mermaid.md](./docs/demos/mermaid/craft-business-lead-to-order.mermaid.md)
- Markdown demo: [docs/demos/markdown/craft-business-lead-to-order.summary.md](./docs/demos/markdown/craft-business-lead-to-order.summary.md)

## Core Blocks

- `process`: step-by-step operational workflows
- `stateflow`: legal states and transitions
- `rule`: cross-cutting constraints and requirements
- `role`: permission boundaries
- `policy`: context-driven or time-driven behavior
- `event`: named triggers with reactions
- `metric`: tracked business measures

## Comments and Annotations

OrgScript supports two documentation layers:

- `# comment` for human-only notes
- `@key "value"` for allowlisted structured metadata

Comments are non-authoritative and excluded from canonical export, AI context, analysis, and machine-facing evaluation by default.

Annotations are parseable metadata. In v1 the allowlist is:

- `@note`
- `@owner`
- `@todo`
- `@source`
- `@status`
- `@review`

Example:

```orgs
# Shared lead qualification path for inbound leads.
@owner "sales_ops"
@status "active"
process LeadQualification

  # New leads enter the qualification flow when created.
  when lead.created
```

Export behavior:

- `orgscript export markdown <file>` and `orgscript export html <file>` omit annotation callouts by default.
- Add `--with-annotations` to Markdown or HTML export when you want allowlisted `@annotations` rendered in the generated documentation artifact.
- `orgscript export context <file>` includes explicit annotation metadata in the structured context payload so downstream AI/indexing consumers do not need to recover it from prose.

## CLI Quick Reference

```bash
orgscript validate <file> [--json]
orgscript lint <file> [--json]
orgscript check <file> [--json]
orgscript format <file> [--check]
orgscript export json <file>
orgscript export markdown <file>
orgscript export mermaid <file>
orgscript export html <file>
orgscript export context <file>
orgscript analyze <file> [--json]
```

Examples:

```bash
orgscript export markdown ./examples/lead-qualification.orgs --with-annotations
orgscript export html ./examples/lead-qualification.orgs --with-annotations
orgscript export context ./examples/lead-qualification.orgs
```

## Developer Path

If you want to contribute to the tooling or language, this is a practical sequence:

1. Read [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md)
2. Run `orgscript check` on a real example
3. Inspect generated Mermaid or Markdown output
4. Read the canonical spec
5. Use [docs/governance.md](./docs/governance.md) before proposing core language changes

## Testing

```bash
npm test
npm run check:all
npm run demo:generate
```
